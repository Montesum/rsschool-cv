## About me
I'm a 24 years old now radio engineer of tomography and worked at my last office more than three years. After all that time I've start to think that my actual job can affect to me too much. Even a few several months and I'll become sluggish and this is absolutely not what I wanted in my career. So I've decited to go out of my comfort zone and try something new and finally choose RS School and theit course JS cause I'me really appreciate their way to teatching students by hard selfmade work. My general goal now is to obtain knowledge in the sphere of front-end development.

## Code examples
Part of my resolution to task from previously studying at the university. Approximation of the function. Least squares method
```C++
int main()
{
	int i, j, k, h, g, m, n;
	float p , r , u, x[22], f[22], d[22], c[3][4], a[3], s = 0.0, q[22];

	fopen_s(&O, "rezult_out.txt", "r+");
	fscanf_s(O, "%f %f %d %d", &p, &r, &n, &m);
	fclose(O);

	cout << "Znachenie funkcii v uzlovih tochkah:" << endl;
	for (i = 1; i <= m; i++)  //считаем и выводим значение функции в узловых точках
	{
		x[i] = p + (i - 1)*(r - p) / (m - 1);
		f[i] = 4 * x[i] - 7 * sin(x[i]);
		printf("x%i=%2.2f  f(X%i)=%3.6f\n", i, x[i], i, f[i]);
	}
	printf("\n");
```
